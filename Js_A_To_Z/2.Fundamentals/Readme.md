## 1.[JavaScript Syntax](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-syntax/)

## Whitespace
Whitespace refers to characters that provide the space between other characters. JavaScript has the following whitespace:

- Carriage return
- Space
- New Line
- tab

JavaScript engine ignores whitespace. However, you can use whitespace to format the code to make it easy to read and maintain.

## Statements

A statement is a code that declares a variable or instructs the JavaScript engine to do a task. A simple statement is terminated by a semicolon ( ; ).

    let message = "Welcome to JavaScript";
    console.log(message);

## Blocks
A block is a sequence of zero or more simple statements. A block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets { }. For example:

    if (window.localStorage) {
    console.log('The local storage is supported');
    }


## Identifiers

- An identifier is a name you choose for variables, parameters, functions, classes, etc. An identifier name starts with a letter (a-z, or A-Z), an underscore(_), or a dollar sign ($).


- Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, the message is different from the Message.


## Comments

- Comments allow you to add notes or hints to JavaScript code. When executing the code, the JavaScript engine ignores the comments.

- JavaScript supports single-line and block comments.

Single-line comments =  // single line comment  
Multi-line comments =  /* this is multiline comment */  

## Expressions
An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value.

 example:

        1+2


<b>Note : </b> Do not use the reserved keywords and reserved words for identifers.
